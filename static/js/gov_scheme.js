    <p><b>Scheme Name:</b><br/>
Empowerment and Self-Respect Scheme for Landless Below Poverty Line Adivasis</p>

<p><b>Nature of the Scheme:</b><br/>
Under this scheme, landless Adivasis below the poverty line are provided with either 4 acres of dry (rain‑fed) agricultural land or 2 acres of irrigated agricultural land.</p>

<p><b>Objectives of the Scheme:</b><br/>
To provide cultivable land to landless families living below the poverty line so that they get a stable source of income, their standard of living improves, and their dependence on agricultural wage labour is reduced. For this purpose, the Government is implementing the Self‑Respect and Empowerment Scheme.</p>

<p><b>Implementation Procedure:</b><br/>
The Empowerment and Self‑Respect Scheme for Landless Below Poverty Line Adivasis has been implemented since 24 February 2004. As per the Government Resolution dated 28 July 2021 for Scheduled Tribes, the scheme has been updated so that beneficiaries are given 4 acres of dry (rain‑fed) land or 2 acres of irrigated land. For dry land, a provision of Rs. 5.00 lakh per acre is made, and for irrigated land, a provision of Rs. 8.00 lakh per acre is made.<br/>
The scheme is 100% grant‑based and is implemented at the district level. Funds for the scheme are released to the respective District Collectors under the District Annual Tribal Sub‑Plan. A District‑level Committee headed by the District Collector is constituted to fix land rates, purchase land, and select beneficiaries. To assist this process, a Taluka‑level Sub‑Committee headed by the concerned Sub‑Divisional Officer is formed for each taluka to help in land purchase and distribution to beneficiaries.</p>

<p><b>Beneficiary Selection / Implementation Criteria:</b><br/>
The minimum age of the beneficiary shall be 18 years and the maximum age 60 years. Only landless Adivasis are eligible to receive benefits. The land will be registered in the joint names of husband and wife of the landless Adivasi family. However, in the case of widows and deserted women, the land will be registered in their own name. The selected beneficiary must be a landless agricultural labourer living below the poverty line. Among the beneficiaries selected for this scheme, the following categories will be given priority:</p>
